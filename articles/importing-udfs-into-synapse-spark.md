# Importing user-defined functions into Synapse Spark 


Managing large PySpark functions can become cumbersome, especially when the same logic needs to be replicated across multiple scripts. 
Fortunately, there are several effective methods for storing user-defined functions, enabling seamless reuse without the need for repetitive coding. 
This documentation outlines options for organizing and reusing functions efficiently, streamlining your workflow and promoting code consistency.

# Option 1: 
One effective approach is to maintain a dedicated Spark notebook, such as a NotebookUtils, within a utils folder to house all commonly used functions. 
By including the line 
`%run /utils/NotebookUtils` 
at the beginning of any primary notebook, all necessary functions are seamlessly imported into the session each time the notebook is executed. 
This method closely mirrors the integration of a wheel file, streamlining function reuse and ensuring consistency across your environment.
